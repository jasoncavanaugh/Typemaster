# Typemaster
This is a typing application that allows the user to practice typing texts and see their WPM. The idea came to me over COVID quarantine when I got really into playing Typeracer online and wanted to improve my typing speed. The application allows the user to add their own texts that they would like to type out, which are saved locally on their machine. In the future, it would be nice to add user data (average WPM, total number of texts typed, average accuracy, data on improvement over time, etc.).
