Without the underlying assumption that man's deliberate reason is too limited
 to undertake comprehensive social planning, an entirely different set of 
conclusions emerges in field after field. If, for example, effective rational 
planning and direct control of an entire economic system is possible, then it 
is clearly more efficient to reach desired results directly in this way, 
rather than as the end result of circuitous and uncontrolled processes.
