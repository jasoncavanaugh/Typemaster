Throughout history, when leaders have tried to unite a social group, they have 
trained their members to think of it as a family and to redirect their 
familial emotions inside it. The names used by groups that strive for 
solidarity - brethren, brotherhoods, fraternal organizations, sisterhood, 
sororities, crime families, the family of man - concede in their metaphors 
that kinship is the paradigm to which they aspire.
